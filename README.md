To execute Go code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Go: If you haven't already, you need to install Go on your system. You can download the official distribution of Go from the Go website (https://golang.org/) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.


2. Set up the Go workspace: Go requires a specific directory structure called the Go workspace. The workspace contains the Go source files, packages, and binaries. By default, the Go workspace is located in the `GOPATH` environment variable. Create a directory for your Go workspace, if you haven't already, and set the `GOPATH` environment variable to point to that directory.

3.Installation:
```shell
 $ git clone https://github.com/Eddie120/MachEight.git
```

4. Open a terminal or command prompt: Open a terminal or command prompt window in the directory where you saved the Go source file (`main.go`).

5. Build and run the code: Use the `go run` command to compile and run the Go code. In the terminal, run the following command:

```shell
go run main.go
```

   The `go run` command compiles and executes the Go code in the specified file (`main.go` in this case).

6. View the output: After executing the `go run` command, you should see the output of the program printed in the terminal.

That's it! You have successfully executed the Go code. You can modify the code and rerun the `go run` command to see different results. Additionally, you can use other Go commands like `go build` to compile the code into an executable binary and `go install` to build and install the package in your Go workspace.

Note: Make sure that you have Go properly installed and configured on your system before attempting to execute Go code.
